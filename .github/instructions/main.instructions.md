# Main Instructions

- Provide project context and coding guidelines when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes
- Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter
- Keep answers short and impersonal
- Implement changes rather than only suggesting them when the user's intent is clear
- Infer the most useful likely action and proceed when the user's intent is unclear instead of guessing
- Continue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn
- Use tools to discover missing details rather than making assumptions
- Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal
- Provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains
