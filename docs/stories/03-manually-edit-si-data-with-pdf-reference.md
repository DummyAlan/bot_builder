# User Story: 3 - Manually Edit SI Data with PDF Reference

**As an** external customer,
**I want** to manually edit extracted SI data with inline suggestions while viewing the original PDF,
**so that** I can quickly correct any extraction errors or validation issues that couldn't be auto-fixed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- User can edit any extracted field in the form
- Inline suggestions are provided for fields that require correction
- Original SI PDF is displayed alongside the editable form for easy reference
- Form highlights fields that require manual attention
- User can view and compare PDF content with extracted data side-by-side
- Changes are saved and re-validated in real-time

## Notes

- Side-by-side view should be intuitive and responsive
- Consider highlighting or scrolling to relevant sections of the PDF when editing specific fields
- Inline suggestions should guide users toward valid input formats
